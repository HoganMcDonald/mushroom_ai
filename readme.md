# Mushroom AI

I have been studying deep learning and recently as of writing this received a certification. I learned in my course how 
to write a deep neural network for binary classification with a single output neuron. In future courses I will learn 
how to expand on that.

For now, I would like to implement what I have learned in a simple restful api written in python that can be used to 
identify mushrooms. My hope is that this api could be used in a colleagues mobile application.
